## Project: Responsive Web Design

This project was proposed by the bootcamp to enhance skills in responsive web design, utilizing CSS3 *media queries* properties to ensure the interface is adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS**: Application of responsiveness techniques with *media queries*, and style customization to ensure a good experience on devices of various sizes.

## Key feacture Learned

During the development of this project, the following concepts were applied:
- **Responsiveness**: Use of *media queries* to adjust the page layout across different devices.
- **Percentage-based Margins and Padding**: Adjusting margins and padding using percentage values, ensuring layout flexibility and adaptability.
- **Relative Dimensions in Figma**: Creating layouts and elements that adapt to different screen sizes, based on prototypes developed in Figma.
- **Using @font-face**: Implementing custom fonts on the website, ensuring design consistency.
- **Deployment on GitHub Pages**: Publishing the final project on GitHub Pages for online viewing and testing across different devices.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a solid skill set in responsive web design using CSS3 and *media queries* properties. The project focuses on building a scalable and adaptable structure, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

## Continuation of Bootcamp Sprint

This project is a continuation of the sprint proposed by the bootcamp, where we deepened our understanding of several key concepts in web development:

- **CSS Grid**: Mastered the use of the grid property to create complex and flexible layouts.
- **Git Branching**: Gained a better understanding of how to use Git branching to manage and organize code changes during development.
- **CSS Shadows and Gradients**: Implemented CSS shadows and gradients to enhance the visual appeal of the project, adding depth and color transitions.

These additional topics were integral in further developing our skills in responsive web design and version control, contributing to the overall quality and functionality of the project.
